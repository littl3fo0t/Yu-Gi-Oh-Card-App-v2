# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Searching App (Version 2)
This is the second version of a series of simple card searching apps I've built for the **Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game** - this time made using React, Redux, TypeScript and Vite. However, just like the first one, this version uses the free Yu-Gi-Oh! card API from the [YGOProDeck Webiste](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) and [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) for the styling.
If you are wondering why a Yu-Gi-Oh! card searching app, please see the [```README.md```](https://github.com/littl3fo0t/Yu-Gi-Oh-Card-App/blob/main/README.md) file from the first version.
